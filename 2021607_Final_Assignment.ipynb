The dataset contains 11 columns: `\"bedrooms\"`, `\"bathrooms\"`, `\"sqft_living\"`, `\"sqft_lot\"`, `\"floors\"`, `\"condition\"`, `\"grade\"`, `\"sqft_above\"`, `\"sqft_basement\"`, `\"age\"`and `\"price\"`.\n","Use `pd.read_excel()` to read the file and make prediction of whether a given house is likely to be expensive based on the features related to the house.\n","\n","Use KNN and OLS regression independently to determine and compare their performance in terms of accuracy and confusion matrix.\n","\n","To accomplish this task, you will have to convert the values under `\"price\"` into one of two possible values: **1** and **0** denoting \"expensive\" and \"cheap\" respectively. For this, if the price of the house is less than `450000`, it is \"cheap\"; otherwise it is \"expensive\" . \n","\n","**Note:**This conversion must be done before training for KNN, and after conversa for OLS regression, on each predicted `\"price\"`."],"metadata":{"id":"uh70DOy-BPfk"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix\n","\n","data = pd.read_excel('/content/house_data.xlsx')\n","\n","data['price'] = np.where(data['price']>=450000, 1, 0)\n","\n","train_data, test_data = train_test_split(data, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n","\n","def knn_predict(train_data, test_data, k):\n","    y_pred = []\n","    for i in range(len(test_data)):\n","        distances = np.sqrt(np.sum(np.square(np.subtract(train_data[:,:-1],test_data[i,:-1])), axis=1))\n","        nearest_indices = np.argsort(distances)[:k]\n","        nearest_labels = train_data[nearest_indices,-1].tolist()\n","        y_pred.append(max(set(nearest_labels), key=nearest_labels.count))\n","    return y_pred\n","\n","def ols_predict(train_data, test_data):\n","    X_train = train_data[:,:-1]\n","    y_train = train_data[:,-1].reshape(-1,1)\n","    X_test = test_data[:,:-1]\n","    X_train = np.concatenate([np.ones((X_train.shape[0],1)), X_train], axis=1)\n","    X_test = np.concatenate([np.ones((X_test.shape[0],1)), X_test], axis=1)\n","    beta = np.linalg.inv(X_train.T @ X_train) @ X_train.T @ y_train\n","    y_pred = np.where(X_test @ beta >= 0.5, 1, 0)\n","    return y_pred\n","\n","train_data = train_data.values\n","test_data = test_data.values\n","\n","k = 5\n","y_test_knn = test_data[:,-1].tolist()\n","y_pred_knn = knn_predict(train_data, test_data, k)\n","y_test_ols = test_data[:,-1].reshape(-1,1)\n","y_pred_ols = ols_predict(train_data, test_data)\n","\n","print('KNN:')\n","print('Accuracy:', accuracy_score(y_test_knn, y_pred_knn))\n","print('Confusion Matrix:\\n', confusion_matrix(y_test_knn, y_pred_knn))\n","print('OLS Regression:')\n","print('Accuracy:', accuracy_score(y_test_ols, y_pred_ols))\n","print('Confusion Matrix:\\n', confusion_matrix(y_test_ols, y_pred_ols))"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Nt86jrpYsW8J","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1682700946662,"user_tz":-360,"elapsed":19550,"user":{"displayName":"Syed Niaz Mohtasim","userId":"03318332779880490660"}},"outputId":"d342b8d9-e934-453e-f16d-c7d148f99299"},"execution_count":6,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["KNN:\n","Accuracy: 0.7284293314827666\n","Confusion Matrix:\n"," [[1571  533]\n"," [ 641 1578]]\n","OLS Regression:\n","Accuracy: 0.5910247513300948\n","Confusion Matrix:\n"," [[1916  188]\n"," [1580  639]]\n"]}]}]}
